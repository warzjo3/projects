# Assignment #2
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with n-gram language modeling and a handful of smoothing techniques.

Steps to this assignment are as follows:
  * Read the Assignment2.pdf file thoroughly
  * Modify the .ipynb files in this repository with your code to fulfill the assignment requirements. 
  * Use Git to add and commit your changes
  * Use Git to push your changes to GitHub
  
Do let us know on Canvas if you have questions.

* Note 1: Please use relative paths instead of absolute paths to locations on your machine.
* Note 2: Some of these models may take a while to train. If your model takes 5+ minutes to train, we recommend that you save the models (e.g. using pickle's serialization functionality) and then add/commit/push these saved models to your repository. Write in some functionalit(y|ies) to read those models in so we can run your code and validate quicker. If you have questions about how to pickle language models reach out to us on Canvas or come to office hours.
